Pull requests are welcome
- [ ] Vibrator sensor to detect how many cups is brewd for stats
- [ ] On state for HA when brewing is kicked off, maybe trigger a countdown timer after water is drained off from the tank?
- [ ] Switch sensor for the filter holder to notify to change it until its triggered
- [ ] Stats in HA or Grafana on manual vs HA triggered brewing + how many cups
- [ ] Make blueprints from the example automations from the <a href='https://lezg.in/adding-an-api-to-my-grind-and-brew-coffee-machine-to-make-it-smart/'>article</a>
- [ ] A sensor to be put in the grinder container to count or measure the beans left to give a warning if its to low and dont start if it is empty.
